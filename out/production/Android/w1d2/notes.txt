4/26:

Introduction to Java
First java program
JVM, JRE, JDK
methods and parameters
method overloading and overriding
File I/O
Exceptions
Control flow (while, if)
Primitive types / first objects
Intro to Git (clone, init, add, commit, push, pull, branch, merge, checkout)
Basic unix commands (cd, mkdir, ls/dir, cp/copy, echo/touch)

katakoda.com (good for getting better at unix / git commands)

4/27:

Objects,
Memory (pass-by-reference)
Arrays
Control flow (for loops, do while)
Access modifiers (like public, private, default, protected)
    public = entire project. private = declared within class only. default = package only. protected = subclasses only
Packages / imports
Try/catch
Runtime exceptions vs exception / unchecked vs checked exception
Method return types
Static keyword
"one instance" -> the method or variable or object belongs to the class definition rather than an object instance
Constructors
method invoked when we use new keyword to create object - make your own constructor or use default constructor
'this' keyword
for resolving ambiguity mostly
Strings
    Strings and their methods
    charAt, indexOf, substring, contains.. these are all useful string methods

4/28
The collection framework
    ArrayList, LinkedList, Queue, Stack, etc
    Basic interfaces of collections - like List, Set, Map, etc
Generics
    Generics allow you to store data of any type - specifically, we can designate a object that uses generics
    to be something like a Object<Type> - something like <T> is a stand-in for any type of object
Object class
    All objects in java are descended from the object class, which contains some amount of useful methods that
    we most likely overwrite
        toString,
        hashcode,
        equals
Garbage Collection
    If nothing is pointing to an object, it's automatically removed from memory
Memory in java
    memory in java works through the stack and the head..
        stack: primitive types, as well as the call stack (java keep track of all method calls so that way it knows
            where to return when a method is finished)
        heap: where object memory is stored.. as well as the 'string pool'
        string pool:
            i mentioned that strings are special types of objects..
            even though they are technically objects, we use them so often that they have a special memory location
            in which identical strings share the same memory space
                so..
                String a = "truck";
                String b = "truck";
                actually point to the same memory location
                THIS IS NOT TRUE FOR ANY OTHER TYPE OF OBJECT!
Scanner input from user
Wrapper classes
    autoboxing/autounboxing allows us to conver wrapper classes to primitives and vice versa automatically
Scope
    for example, if using a for loop, and use int i  =0, that i is limited to the scope of the for loop
    jurisdiction over a variable
    lifespan of datatype
    in java specifically: block (loops, if), method (within a method), object scope (within an object), class (static)


my recommendation: know 'what' something is and 'why' we use it

Today I mentioned appending a word to an existing within a method that returns the words together...

What if you made a method that appends a single character, but when the array runs out of space, you double
the size of that array?
    What's the process?
    method->
    before checking, verify if there is space
        how do we do that? check if the current number of characters is less that the amount of space in the array
        (using something like my length variable in 'word')
        if there is space, great, add the character and increment length
        if not, you'll have to double the length of the array:
        meaning, create an array of 2x the length, and copy the elements of the old array over
        and then append the character and increment length
